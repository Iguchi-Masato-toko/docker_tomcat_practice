# docker_tomcat_practice

## 🐳 Docker ToDo App
This is my first development project using Docker.
Some parts of the implementation were assisted by GitHub Copilot.
## 🚀 Getting Started
To launch the application, run the following command in your shell:

`docker compose up -d`


Once the containers are running, open the following URL in your preferred browser to access the simple ToDo page:
http://localhost:8090/todoApp/todo


## 🎨 Styling
This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling.
